        <h2>What is Sequential File Allocation?</h2>
        <p>Sequential file allocation is a method used for organizing files on a disk. In this allocation scheme, files are stored on the disk one after another in a sequential manner, without any gaps between them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When a new file is allocated, it is placed immediately after the last file on the disk. The starting address of each file is determined by the end address of the previous file. This ensures that files are stored in a continuous block of disk space.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sequential file allocation provides simplicity in terms of file retrieval, as files can be easily accessed by traversing them sequentially from the beginning. However, it can suffer from the problem of fragmentation. As files are continuously added and removed, free disk space becomes fragmented, resulting in inefficient utilization of storage capacity.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Advantages of Sequential File Allocation:</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Simple and easy to implement.</li>
          <li>Sequential access to files is efficient.</li>
          <li>No additional data structures are required to track file locations.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Disadvantages of Sequential File Allocation:</h3>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Fragmentation of free disk space can occur, leading to inefficient storage utilization.</li>
          <li>Deleting or modifying files can result in wasted space.</li>
          <li>Files cannot be easily inserted or resized without causing fragmentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Sequential file allocation is a simple and straightforward method for organizing files on a disk. It provides efficient sequential access to files but may suffer from fragmentation and limited flexibility in file management. Other file allocation methods, such as linked allocation or indexed allocation, address some of these limitations.</p>
